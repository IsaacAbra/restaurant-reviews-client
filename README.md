#This is my restaurant-reviewing app's front-end

## My app's front-end

Here, one can log their restaurants onto the site and keep up with their personal reviews since we can,
at times, be somewhat forgetful of our dining experiences. Using this app, we can now have a fun way to
log-in, sign-out, and write our own reviews as though the aesthetically pleasing site belongs to us too . Therein lies the concept I've wanted others to immerse in and enjoy. (mouth-watering steaks galore!)

## Planning

I was cognizant that this app was built as a full-stack project and I accordingly made a plan to create
user stories and wireframes, which I consequently used to keep track of my own progress and used each
(then hypothetical) aspect as a stepping stone to create the product we now see and love.

That was settled, and I worked on the back-end portion by making the schemas/models between my user/restaurants. I've also had to create my curl-scripts for eventual authentication and the restaurant reviews.

I was subsequent able to begin the front-end development of this project and created the relationships I've
wanted between the different elements of the site.
Here's how it went :

- sign-in
- sign-up
- change password
- view restaurant reviews
- add restaurant reviews
- edit restaurant reviews
- view a specific restaurant review
- update/edit restaurant information

All in all, it was a great experience and I've developed a deeper insight and greater appreciation for the aesthetics I encounter in any pixelated screen.

Now, here are my user stories
vvv
## User stories

- As a user, I'd like to sign-up for a user account
- As a user, I'd like to sign-in for a user account
- As a user, I'd like to change my account's password in case I suspect a break-in.
- As a user, I'd like to sign-out when I feel like my work is done.
- As a user, I'd like to add tasty restaurants to my list that will stay put after I log out.
- As a user, I'd like to add an out of 5 rating, a name, location, and a short review for each restaurant (elaboration of the proceeding user story)
-  As a user, I'd like to then edit/delete the tasty restaurants that I've already then added.
